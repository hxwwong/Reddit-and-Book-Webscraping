I would prefer PS4 but unhappy that it‚Äôs not cross progression... if I play on pc I believe I can alternate with mobile!

As mostly of you guys I am very excited with the game, planning playing it on PS4 and Mobile, but I am not that happy with the notice that cross-save isn't allowed for PS4 players, which seems probably a Sony's Political problem.

So here goes my question: how can we change it? Since we are the community who will actually play and pay* for it.



Should we do a petition for them to allow cross-save and find another way to get the money from us?

OR should we do a riot and boycott Sony at some lvl? More aggressively? (I prefere the first option but I am pretty new to Sony and dunno if they r gonna listen)

26,Meganezuki,1599045779,43,1,"Dear Travelers,

We recently reached the milestone of 10,000 users at r/Genshin_Impact and thought it would be a great time to give you an update on what the mod team is doing to make this a more welcoming community for everyone.
 
August 2020 has been by far the most active month yet, with 3,632 new subscribers and 638,339 page views. Seeing this influx of users, we have written an [in-depth FAQ page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uN-cMLMVxHlvaCroprmgZcbvc7uMxOpJvKBUdOensgc/edit?usp=sharing) containing a compilation of questions we received regularly in the past few weeks, which will be expanded if necessary. Moreover, we prepared a [mobile hardware chart](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g0lfIVvYTsaJJZVYnnGoMv_Bs9MmniOo/view) to classify expected device performance, given that this is a very popular topic. Both of these resources are now linked from the sidebar or the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù tab in the mobile app.
 
To reinforce this action, we set up an automated welcome message that new members will receive immediately after joining the subreddit, which includes a link to the new FAQ page.
 
Our hope is that these changes, together with the updated [General Information](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/iij7eh/all_you_need_to_know_about_genshin_impact_v3/) thread, will make newcomers less dependent on the search function or other users to find basic information. Having said that, we do encourage the use of the Q&amp;A thread and of course new threads are always welcome for discussions and all other kinds of content. We would like to use this opportunity to express our gratitude to those of you who actively participate in the Q&amp;A thread answering other people‚Äôs questions. Thank you very much!
 
The sidebar has also seen the addition of the subreddit rules, which we expect to become more relevant once the game releases and even more users join us, but we trust you will acknowledge them from now.
 
Lastly, we added user flairs for all characters present in the official website. Up to 2 character emojis plus text can be entered, which will appear next to your username. You can edit your flair on the sidebar (the Reddit app does not allow you to create a flair but if you make it from the browser version of Reddit it will be visible in the app too.)
To use 2 emojis, select the first one and then manually write the name of the second character in lowercase between colons, for example:

&gt; :amber: Knights of Favonius :kaeya:

If you have questions, suggestions or ideas feel free to reach out to us!
 
We are super excited to start a new adventure on September 28th and to build a great community around it. Thank you for being part of it.

I've been really happy to hear he's a free story character, and while I know welfare units are usually not great in Gachas, lately I've seen a lot of threads/tier lists (I know, those are questionable in a PvE game but some units WILL be better than others), and Kaeya seems to be at the very bottom, or not even on the lists.

I'm still really looking forward to the general experience of the game, I missed all Betas sadly, but I feel like this game is something I've been looking forward to for a long time despite not really following its development for too long. It's always difficult to ask, ""Will I still have fun?"" because I know I will.
But is Kaeya really that bad? Dude's hot and looks fun, and I know I'll try to max him out even if he's mediocre, but do you think there could be a gatekeeping thing in co-op play happening at some point, locking you out of content if you don't have the latest meta defining character?

I played Honkai Impact 3rd for a bit to get a taste of what Mihoyo games are like, and I feel like even if a character is a low rank / easy to get, you can still invest and make them good. Maybe not as meta-defining and brokenly strong as others, but viable nonetheless.

tl;dr: Will Kaeya really be trash, or do you think he's perfectly fine to use for most content?",Genshin_Impact,Is Kaeya really this bad?

155,darkandark,1599678558,77,1,"Hey everyone, I am sure many of you are as excited as I am for the launch of Genshin Impact, and regardless of the topics I am about to discuss, I still plan on playing the game.

I've waiting a long time to bring these issues up, hoping we'd hear something about the potential for fixes, but its been pretty much radio silence from the development team about game features.

I wanted to bring up a number of issues with Genshin Impact that I feel have not gotten very much attention. I am sure miHoYo staff are super busy preparing for launch, but a nod to the following issues, or at least acknowledgement of the issues would help greatly.

We've all but had zero developer communication and response about game features since the last [Paimon Sharing Session #12](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/4385)

Everything below, I've submitted as feedback and suggestions to miHoYo during their CBT2 and CBT3 tests.

**1. Co-op game flow and vendor lockout** Copy pasta'd from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/ipec5i/do_we_have_any_news_if_coop_is_being_improved/g4kft5z/).

Have we seen, or gotten any confirmation of improvements to co-op QoL and vendor lock out issues since CBT3?

One of the major complaints for co-op in CBT2 and CBT3 is the fact that certain vendors are locked out for all players when you join someone else's world or someone joins yours. Katheryn for sure is locked out and I am pretty sure the forge-smith guy, crafting table, ingredient shop owner and the shop owner where you exchange sigils, are all locked when in co-op.

This is a massive issue that I know more than a few people put suggestions into CBT2/3 to fix. Does anyone know if miHoYo fixed this? Its going to sour the co-op experience greatly if this is how its going to be on launch.

For example, say you login for first time of the day, and you want to play with your friends, you haven't completed any of your BP dailies or your commissions. So your friends join your world and you guys have a merry-jolly time going around the map, completing commissions, and killing cubes/leylines/world bosses for dailies. After about 45 mins of doing dailies, you're done with commissions, you ranked up your adventure level, and you now have enough fragments/agates to ascend one of your new characters.

You go back to town to collect your new AR rewards, craft some materials for ascension, buy some ingredients for cooking, BUT OH NO, ALL vendors are locked. You're forced to KICK/DISBAND your entire team and everyone needs to go through another load cycle for you to return to your world. And then, and only then, can you interact with vendors and do everything you need.

And now if you want to play with your friends again, you have to re-invite and accept into your host world all over again.  This needs to happen everything, anyones, wants to access a vendor.

This is a horrible game design / flow and I really hope miHoYo fixed this. Its pretty bad not going to lie.  The fact that between CBT2 and CBT3 we did not see this fix was extremely worrying.

**2. Keyboard/Gamepad key re-binding or configuration**

As many of the CBT2 and CBT3 testers know, and even as recent as PS4 beta, there was absolutely NO ability in the settings menu to re-bind ANY of the keys in Genshin Impact.  For controller people, this isn't as big of an issue, but for Keyboard / Mouse users, the fact that key binding is a MISSING feature is unbelievable.  One of the largest issues with playing Genshin Impact on Keyboard / Mouse is when you need to break status effects like ""Frozen/Ice""; on the keyboard you're forced to mash the Spacebar.  We need the ability to rebind this key to something more accessible and won't break my thumb.

Mashing the spacebar is not the most ideal, as you have to press it multiple times in succession to break the ice.

There is also the obvious disability, accessibility, and left hand users concern as well.  Without keybinding for Keyboard / Mouse, Genshin is basically shutting out a subset of players, and not letting them reconfigure their desire control scheme to enjoy Genshin Impact the way they can/want.

Comon miHoYo, we need some confirmation about this.

**3. Scene replay functionality**

Genshin Impact's story and voice acting is one of its major selling points. With all the Japanese VA talent and even excellent CN dubbing they've done, its a huge pity that there is no scene replay functionality in the game. Once you complete a story scene, there is no way to return to re-watch that scene again, or even replay it in a different language to see how it sounds with different voice actors.

What gives? This would be a fantastic feature and I am sure it would help a lot of people.  Genshin Impact has a number of super well animated story sequences as well. Locking people out from revisiting these, seems like a completely missed potential.

===

The game is launching in less than 5 days in China, and global has 18-19 days left.  If none of the features are implemented or fixed already, especially vendor lock out and key rebinding, that would be extremely unfortunate as there is probably no more time left to get those fixes in for v1.1 release. /u/Murdon can you speak to any of these?",Genshin_Impact,Game issues with Genshin Impact; miHoYo Please.

I've been eating away at information ever since the existence of the wonderful world of Genshin Impact was made known to me, but some things are still a bit unclear to me. 

Hoping you can help me clear them up!

First off, I've pre-registered on a few email adresses just because I had them readily available. Not sure if it will prove to be useful or they won't be used, it won't hurt having them in the end. 

Are the first rolls you get for free (20 iirc) different than other ones? As in, can you use the first free rolls only right when you start, or could they potentially be kept for things released at a later date? 

Would it be adviseable to use them right away to, perhaps, get some characters unlocked to be able to play the game? Or are the freely unlocked characters sufficient to progress?

I've been eating away at information ever since the existence of the wonderful world of Genshin Impact was made known to me, but some things are still a bit unclear to me. 

Hoping you can help me clear them up!

First off, I've pre-registered on a few email adresses just because I had them readily available. Not sure if it will prove to be useful or they won't be used, it won't hurt having them in the end. 

Are the first rolls you get for free (20 iirc) different than other ones? As in, can you use the first free rolls only right when you start, or could they potentially be kept for things released at a later date? 

Would it be adviseable to use them right away to, perhaps, get some characters unlocked to be able to play the game? Or are the freely unlocked characters sufficient to progress?

I have to say that I really dislike the concept of gacha (or any other casino-like ""features""), so I'm still not fully convinced about giving Genshin Impact a try.

My objectives would be to explore the world, enjoy the story and collect all characters. I'm not a min/maxer so I don't need to have the Best In Slot items, but I'm kind of a soft-collector so I will definitely want to have all characters unlocked. How long does it take to unlock a character by just playing the game, if I play maybe 4-5 hours per week?

Also, while I mentioned in the title that I would be a F2P player, I don't mind spending 30-60‚Ç¨ if the game is good. If the characters have to be unlocked by paying rather than playing, how much does it cost to unlock each character?

I am having several problems with miHoYo forum when try to link my gmail on it.


At first, I tried to sign in with the ""Username"" type of registration, the one that doesn't ask for your email, but somehow it didn't worked and I kinda locked my main nickname in a ""ghost account"", lost my nick forever.

The nickname was: Kardejin (my psn ID) 

Then, I tried to sign in with an Gmail account, the same I have used to Pre-register (the account that I would use to play genshin) since the previously form didn't worked. And it didn't worked as well, it says ""Email format invalid/error""... 


... Ok ok, I created an Outlook email only to register on forum, and that time all went good, but due the fact that my name is already taken by me (ironically) I had to do a variation, i.e: KardejinPSN


And here comes the main problem:

On ""Get ready for the road"" I tried to complete the task ""link an email"", email that I suppose that will be use to claim the awards once I am in game. But guess what? I can't use the Gmail lol. 

My Twitter account its linked and the email it's the same! Why I it says ""format invalid"" if it is already ""registered"" via Twitter task? 


Anyone knows how to solve it? In resume I need

- Use Kardejin on forum account(would be cool) 

- Use the gmail that I Pre-registered on forum, on their OWN forum. 

- Link the same Gmail on ""Get Ready for the Road"" to claim my awards when the game arrives",Genshin_Impact,Issues with gmail on miHoYo forums

Well, I guess yall know how much noise Genshin Impact is doing on the dozen and dozen of ""Free-to-Play"", ""MMORPG News"", ""Which F2P to play during pandemic"" Youtube channels. At least in my country.

&amp;#x200B;

So seriously, can we talk about monetization ? Will this game be a hard Star-Citizen-Tier-Cash-Grab ?

Can a Free-to-play player really enjoy the game ?

&amp;#x200B;

At first glance on Genshin Impact, I was thinking ""Oh, finally a good Gacha Game, with a nice open world, and free activities, nobody never brought Gacha Style at this point "", but is this just an illusion ?

Won't this game be a new Raid Shadow Legends / Summoners Wars / Clash of Clans / Clash Royale : a simple Cash Grab with a good packaging ?

Just look at the economic model of games like League of Legends, Path of Exile, Spellbreak, Fortnite... A full Free game, with monetization, but also opportunities for F2P players to grind premium content for free. At the cost of hours of playing. Just the best economic model.

I don't have any issues with peoples paying thousands of dollars in Free Games, but let Free Players enjoy the complete game as they want, but more grindy. We all know some peoples will pay astronomic fees, anyway.

This game is not just a mobile gacha hero collector like Honkai Impact, as I understand it is a full pledge mmo now. I am sure the game will be popular at the start, but I wonder if it will remain popular with no character customization at all. Look at other popular mmo games like PSO2 or Sea of Thieves - they all are about characters' looks. I don't say I want total character creation - I understand what hero collector is. But be able to at lest to get different equipable faces/eyes/hairstyles as well as dye-able costumes would be very nice. This is not only a component of every decent mmo but also is a very good stimulant to keep people playing. Sea of Thieves  even doesn't have any in-game progression except cosmetics. And I personally still play PSO2 till that day dye to new AC scratches every few weeks with new cool costumes/haircuts/e.t.c.

I hope devs will think about something like that because I am truly want this game to become popular. Hell, not only popular - but more popular than the titles I mentioned before. I want to play this game for decades to come - so much it has hooked me. I didn't find any suggestion thread on official forum - so I decided to write here.

Since Sony is hard-pressed to almost never allow cross-progression for games like this, I'm assuming PS4's playerbase will start off not bad at all, and then die down within a year. But from what I read, there will be cross-play, so PS4 players can play with others and maybe (hard maybe) one day, Sony will allow cross-progression. 

PC and mobile cross-play and cross-progression sounds like something that will keep that player base going strong, even though PC player bases usually stay stronger for a longer amount of time than console (in a lot of cases, from what I've seen). All in all, I just want to see what everyone will be playing on.

Heck i think i only played summoner wars with such terribly low gacha rates (0.5% for natural 5\*), and i didnt really enjoy the experience.

I know about the pity 90 pulls and the 180 for guaranteed banner 5\*, i also know about the rates up banners have (supposedly... im saying supposedly due to an earlier post of someone doing the math and have it a lower number) 1.6% rate up... which is still kinda low but bearable already.

But my question is... for people who played CBT or OBT CN right now... did you get any 5\* at all? If you rerolled, how long did it took for a 5\*? Or how long did you rerolled until you gave up on a 5\*?

I really want keqing, jean or mona to start the game, but i dont want to burn out from rerolling a lot and getting zip nothing, so i was looking for people who went through that experience to give me an idea of whats to be expected (reasonably... i know its all RNG and some people can get double 5\* to start and some can reroll for a week and get nothing).

335,voyager200,1600180124,9,1,"So as you all know, the game released in China today. I downloaded it to see if my pc would be able to run it at decent fps and it did. I was looking in the various sections and found this. Why would there be the glider from ps4 (which is exclisive) on pc? I have two theories:

1. When the PS4 version releases, maybe we can link the account and on pc it will unlock the glider (for me this is what will likely happen)
2. Is a little farfetched, but maybe it could happen. It's possible that the ps4 and pc version could share the same items but obviously not the progression in game, story wise, and also no ''gems'', only items, weapons and characters.

What do you guys think?  It would be great if the 2nd option was true

336,NoireCupcake,1600174118,18,1,"I'm currently playing Genshin Impact (GI) in the Chinese live version, and it is rather disappointing that the setting has not changed since the CBT.  
This game is also developed for PC, and as a PC user, it is a must to have the game runs at 120 FPS or at the monitor refresh rate ratio. The game only has two options: 30 and 60 FPS. This is 2020, Mihoyo; for cry's sake, if you are going to release the game in PC, make sure you have these essential functions.  
Also, let us map our controls for at least M&amp;K. I don't even know why are you guys locking the control even for M&amp;K. Adding more profile mapping for controller is essential as I can't stand using the X button for decline and O for accept, or O to attack. It ruins the gaming experience so much. Plus, please don't lock the control types, which if we choose either M&amp;K or controller, the game will prevent us from using the other one and vice versa as sometimes I just want to navigate my menu with the mouse which is faster and game with my controller.  
 What's even more disappointing is that HI3 released to PC prior to GI has all these features and how is GI doesn't have?  
The graphics settings can be improved as it offers not many options to meddle with on PC. Adding Field of View would be an essential imo and exclusive fullscreen for other resolution is also a must for better FPS and gaming experience.  
All in all, the game looks great and the port is superior than HI3 port, which is commendable, but the first impression on the setting just ruins it. I hope that Mihoyo somehow able to see this and improve the setting for better gaming experience

TL;DR: Add 120 FPS option, let me map my controls for M&amp;K and controller and add more functions to the graphics setting

I recently read one of today's top articles which mentioned an expected surge in PS4 players early on, which will taper off over the year, partly because of Sony not allowing cross-progression.

Then I realized, the real cause may be the shop pricing. If Genshin Impact's currency and other shop items will cost about as much as your typical gachas out there, you know there will be like $99 for 3 multipull tickets or something. Once PS4 players see that price, they'll just go right back to Fortnite. 

Im not worried about the game's future in mobile or PC, but I think PS4 players are about to learn what most of us already know about gachas. Its make it or break it. Eager to see how things will play out.

See reference here : [ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/8290](https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/8290)

I decided to run a maths analysis to check how those rates makes sense, however the rates just don't add up for me.

My computations and results: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y8BFSf0xjgIyLU7qLwk1FPltxaRnzymskeRlmHgTkjI](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y8BFSf0xjgIyLU7qLwk1FPltxaRnzymskeRlmHgTkjI/edit#gid=1350100845)

For 5\*, computed 1.43%, announced 1.6%

So here I am to show you what I did and to know if someone has a proper explanation to go from the announced ""basic"" rates the ""true"" ones.

My definition of ""basic"" rate is: ""rate that applies if no pity is active""

And ""true"" rate : the ratio for an infinite number of pulls accounting for pity

Here is empirical results from a simple python script (10M pulls) : [https://imgur.com/a/F6wgg42](https://imgur.com/a/F6wgg42)

Perhaps some of you folks who have had the opportunity to play on the CN server can answer some basic questions.

- Do you have to create a new Mihoyo account for every reroll?  Or is there a way to start over without having to use a new e-mail and link a new account.
- I understand rerolling takes about 20 minutes (if you are rushing).  Has anyone done a video guide showing this?
- Who are the best 5* characters to be shooting for when rerolling?  Or is it truly just be happy getting a 5* character at all.

Typically gachas will let you reroll and then let you bind your account when you have your desired roll. I understand not all gachas work like that but most of the ones I‚Äôve played do.

For Genshin impact, is it just like that? Or are you forced to create an account that is essentially auto-bound to an email before you even start playing?

If the above is true, then how does the current ready for the Road Event reward claiming works? I thought to claim rewards you have to bind your account to the account you created for the event? How do you do that if you already bound to another account to play the game?

2) my second biggest worry is the gotcha system. How tedious is it? And is it fun? Is farming  money reasonable? I

I'd like to list out some of the information I know of, to make everyone align their expectation on the game mechanism.

(Please let me know if any of my info is incorrect, I'll update it asap)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Genshin Impact is NOT MMORPG. Genshin has co-op mode where a maximum of 4 players can be in the same world. (1 host + 3 visitors)
2. Since many don't know it yet, tho not related to co-op, killing mob on the map does NOT gives you xp. You get xp by opening loot chests after completed a quest, and the open chest action costs your daily stamina point.
3. All 4 players can choose the same character in the open-world map. However, if the players decided to enter a dungeon, players must choose unique characters.
4. Item drops in open world map mobs are **shared** but **random**, but player A needs pick up the drops when player B defeated the monsters too. Player B picking up the drop does not send the item to everyone's inventory. (Again, no XP)
5. Item drops are **random** for each player, when player A defeated a mob, player A might see a mushroom in the drop, player B might see a meat in the same drop.
6. Mining drops in open world map are **shared** but **random**. Again, all players must pick up the drops themselves.
7. Only host player can talk to NPC.
8. Mobs' HP are **increased** per player in the same world. If player B enters the world when player A is in the middle of the fight, the mob will refresh its HP to align with the new maximum.
9. The number of controllable characters per player depends on the number of players in the same world. If 2 players, each player can controls 2 characters. If 3 players, the 2 visitors can control 1 characters, while host player controls 2.
10. Player with lower world level **cannot** enter world of a player with higher world level. E.g. Player A has world level 1, he cannot enters Player B's world because Player B's world level is 2.
11. Player with higher world level **can** enter the world of a player with lower world level.
12. The difficulty of the mobs depends on host's world level. **The Loot drop level depends on host's world level too.**

Please let me know if there is anything important to add on! Looking forward to play with all of you on the 28th!",Genshin_Impact,[INFO] All information about co-op mode

I have heard much about how GI is not too F2P friendly, and I am someone who has no money to spend on gacha at the moment. Is it possible for me to keep up with the game and not fall too far behind as a F2P player while having an inconsistent play schedule? Or would it be necessary for me to grind daily to be able to meet the meta? Seeing the low gacha rates, I‚Äôd probably only manage a 10x by pure grinding once every three(ish) months, so my fear is that the game will shoot along so quickly I won‚Äôt be able to keep up with new banners and units, and end up falling out of it fairly quickly because of this.",Genshin_Impact,How viable is GI as a casual game?

437,Fullmetal36,1600383560,112,1,"Hey all, I've been playing the Chinese Open Beta and wanted to let everyone know how much you have to play to max out the battle pass.  


First, I'm going to make a few assumptions that I'll quickly list here and I can edit the post if some end up being false:

1. Exp per BP level is always 1000.
2. Daily Missions always give 645 exp.
3. Global Battle Pass is synchronized to China's

Okay, now that we got that out of the way, how much do you have to play to max out the battle pass? When it comes out globally, **we will have 42 days or 6 weeks**. The exp is as follows:

* Daily: 645 exp
* Weekly: 4995 exp
* One time: 6000 exp

Given these numbers and assuming you do all the one time and weekly challenges, you will need to do your dailies **at least 4 days a week!**

However, there is a caveat: in order to start getting your daily exp, you need to get to Adventure Rank 20! **So, this 4 day a week only holds if you are able to get to AR20 on the first few days of release, then you can coast and play less over the next 5 weeks.** 

Next, for people who joined the game after release, or play very short periods everyday, if you do your dailies everyday, the minimum amount of time it will take is 4.5 weeks. So, the deadline to get to AR20 is around October 7 or 8th.^((I'm not too sure on the date since its Chinese time))

Hope this helps everyone.

TL;DR: 

* If you hit AR20 within the first few days: Do your dailies at least 4 days a week.
* If you started playing later or are taking it slow, AR20 by Oct. 7th, and you must do your dailies every day.",Genshin_Impact,Battle Pass Analysis: How dedicated must you be?

For example, Its probably confirmed that character skins will be available later down the road but what about weapon skins? Imagine having transmog in the game and taking cute pictures with them and stuff! Would love if Mihoyo added weapon skins that made your characters look cooler or cuter depending on your preference! (I.E. mushroom sword, leaf umbrella)

while the game is free to play and premiums are primogems, having extra DLC/bundles wouldnt be so bad either. They got to make money somehow and so long as DLC isnt gated content, I would def buy into it. Content expansions could be really cool too

Would also love to see big group raid bosses for co-op play, would be a blast to just group up in an LFG or entire guild and take down a super hard boss. While I do know most of this is kind of MMORPG wishful thinking, i feel it would fit so well in a game like GI!

Why create a multiplayer mode that does not allow quest completion, looting, or any real progression. I get it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù game but if they are trying to evolve this type of game then wouldn‚Äôt creating a more immersive multiplayer experience give more incentive to make purchases? Wanting to put your characters, unlocks in front of other people more often? 

With how restrictive the system is using its resin systems, rewardless multiplayer, progression stop gaps and star rating tricks to incentivize 5 star heroes despite 4 star capability to match, why restrict natural/player based marketing? 

Players are the best tools for your marketing and opening up multiplayer to be worth a dam is the best way to create ‚Äúlook what I have!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI can show you the way‚Äù Moments. These are the best! Having a friend carry you through content and then BAM! Boss wall, dungeon wall, level walls in general. This will more often push players to purchase because the carry unknowingly created a level gap that will look easier to circumvent with a minor extra purchase . It opens up the game to more non-gotcha players that might not normally spend on these games, just because friends pull them in with ‚Äúits free and I can run with you!‚Äù Convincing. They are to scared of loosing a few pennies with people carrying others through that they are going to be missing out on the extended gamer market that hates this shit but might give it a try on consoles especially because ‚Äúfree with friends‚Äù and then get caught in the level fab of carrying. 

They make money, we get better co-op and there are marketing studies that support this kind of approach. The time/personal investment wall. Once your invested emotionally, ie playing with friends/less restricted play, the likelihood of minor spending increases when hit with a level/progression wall. Minor walls with the option of a minor cost to get past will net more purchases then banking solely on gotcha players alone.

457,jimmyspinsggez,1600305171,264,1,"I noticed many people have no clue with the new changes in OCT, so just to adjust everyone's expectation to the game content, I'll list 2 major changes that imo are the most important changes.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Spiral Abyss reset - As all of you know (I hope), spiral abyss was one of the 2 main ways to get priogems for free, as you get rewards for climbing up the levels and the levels reset monthly.
   1. Major change: Now Spiral Abyss's **first 8 levels DON'T RESET MONTHLY**. At current Level 8, mob level is at lv.70, meaning you need 2 teams of lv.80 characters (at least for dps characters) to full clear Spiral Abyss level 8.
   2. Spiral Abyss only reset levels after level 8, at a rate of **twice a month**. which for casual gamers it takes many months to get to that point. No priogems for the first many months unless you grind insanely hard.
2. Character adjustments - We were excited about the game because many free 4\* characters like XiangLing have very good performances so even for poor luck gamers, they have a chance to grind to higher level without 5\* characters. Well, not anymore.
   1. Major change: 2 of the strongest free 4\* characters got **BIG NERF**.  On average cases, MHY increased damage ratio of skills by like 5% and increased CD (cool down) by 25%-100%. Check out the bottom comparison of XiangLing's S1 changes. This kind of changes are implemented everywhere. Aside from XiangLing, Lisa also had her huge nerf on ultimate which is her major AOE skill.

&amp;#x200B;

[Pic is an comparison of XiangLing's S1 in CBT3 \(left\) and in OBT \(right\). Cooldown is doubled.](https://preview.redd.it/1pcqvxbdxln51.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c679551d7d1296bb230feae606969298743e1f4a)

&amp;#x200B;

Not saying the game is no longer playable (like I'm going to empty my wallet so I don't worry much for myself), but the in-game experience will become very difficult and tough for a lot of the new players who are not aware of the situation, and picked the old OP character to invest their limited resources. This is not quite fair for those who had not much luck on gacha.

I do hope MHY look into this as if the game is labeled as f2p, they shouldn't make players life too hard just because they didn't invest tons of money to get their 5\* characters. (Especially when their gacha price is the highest I've seen in my life, and gacha 5\* rate are the lowest I've ever seen in my life)

I'm not going to just slam the conclusion because I am not in the CN OBT currently, so I'll definitely play on the 28th and give some more personal updates on the changes. Looking forward to still see yall there lol.",Genshin_Impact,[Update] Major changes in CN OBT from CBT3

Due to the Rarity of 5-star characters it's going to be likely that as free to play players were likely to be able to build a 4-star Team without too much difficulty.

So my plan with the game as it stands is to get four star weapons and a four-star team early out of the gate and then just slowly work towards five star after a few months.

490,hotbooster9858,1600459774,69,1,"# Genshin Impact Review

After playing the Chinese OBT for around 3 days extensively I'd like to offer some tips and tricks and some feedback for the game in preparation for launch. It's a really nice game and I will definitely play it on launch.

I'm currently AR 24 and I have played through the story up to being send to Liyue.

## The Gacha

After doing the 20 rolls in the Novice Banner (the one with the Noelle background) I got the following:

* Noelle (4\* Geo)
* Beidou (4\* Electro)
* Barbara (4\* Hydro)
* Bennet (4\* Pyro)

After doing 39 pulls in the Standard Banner I got the following:

* Bennet (4\* Pyro)
* Xingqiu (4\* Hydro)
* Favonius Sword (4\* Sword)
* The Flute (4\* Sword)

The rest of the loot were 3\* weapons.

So as you can see, really please for the love of god don't roll on the Standard Banner. If you plan on rerolling, maybe, I don't know if the rates are better but if you don't plan on rerolling just clear out the Novice Banner (16 Acquainted Fates) and stockpile for an event banner. (which might also be on release but even then I'd suggest no rerolling until you got around close to 100 rolls available)

Also single pulls are identical to 10 pulls so ALWAYS single pull, if you get a 4\* before then 10 pull guarantee the counter will reset and you will get another in the next 10 pulls.

The Novice Banner doesn't actually allow you to single pull so don't freak out on that.

## Priorities Early Game

## Adventurer Rank

I'd say that in the first day your priority should be to reach AR 20 and consume all of your stamina on Ley Lines. It's not worth it to do any Domains unless you want to do the 3 Domain Adventurer's Handbook mission.

It's really not hard to do, without even rushing the main questline (I've really explored a lot and ignored it for the most part) I have gotten to AR 17 in the first day. If you just play the main questline and don't get too distracted running to the other edge of the map or trying to climb the tallest mountain in the game, you can definitely do it. Although it will take some commitment.

But why AR 20?

* At AR 14 you get your commissions so you if you feel like you don't have time you can stop here and just do your commissions and logout.
* At AR 20 you get your BP and you will be able to contribute to BP on your first day if you manage to rush it well enough. You will also unlock Spiral Abyss and Xiangling if you clear Floor 3.

## Quests

You should just follow the main questline until you clear the Prologue. The main reason is that ignoring it will block you from accessing some parts of the map or even some characters. You will also get more XP from doing this as well, you don't have to ignore all puzzles and treasures but don't go too far off.

## Party Setup

Most of the time I used this setup:

* Traveler (Anemo), Amber, Barbara, Lisa

The way I approach combat depends on what I'm fighting but most of the time I do the following:

1. Pull with Amber's Charged Shot to apply pyro. Through the taunt as close as possible to the mobs.
2. Use Traveller Wind Burst to spread pyro.
3. Switch to Barbara for the water buff and hit some enemies to apply Vaporize and Hydro.
4. Switch to Lisa to spread Electro-Charge and kite whatever is left alive

Rinse and repeat. You can switch out Barbara for Xingqiu and it will work similarly.

Sometimes you're forced to use Noelle because enemies with Geo Shields are extremely annoying if you don't have a Geo character. In this case just switch to Noelle when the shield is up and just do the first 2 steps and a lot more auto-attacking with the Traveler.

## Should you get the Geo element for the Traveler early on?

I'd say no unless you didn't get Noelle from the Novice Banner. Simply put Anemo deals more damage and works better in most setups unless you have another good main DPS in which case Geo might be better, but it all depends on setup and for most F2P Players I'd say Anemo is better.

## Materials

Collect. Everything.

Well not really everything, you don't have to literally clear all bushes in the game for mushrooms.

* Flowers: The elemental flowers (the ones which you have to vaporize or melt to get them) are good for Alchemy and most of the flowers are Ascension Materials needed for the characters (Anemowheel Aster, Calla Lily, Silk Flower etc.)
* Ores: All of them are important, especially the blue ones. If you see one stop everything that you're doing and go get it, 99% of the time they're more important.
* Vegetables &amp; Fruits: Same as the flowers, the Apples and Sunsettia are useful for healing if you don't have a healer like Barbara and a lot of them Ascension Materials (Philanemo Mushroom, Valberry etc)

## Puzzles

I don't want to spoil you the fun of going 10 hours into the game ignoring some stones because you thought they don't do anything only to learn that they're a puzzle but keep in mind that there are A LOT of puzzles. Everywhere and anywhere so keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that some puzzles will really make you go far away from your current distance, don't just assume they end in your vicinity.

## Character Investments

## 1) Traveller (Anemo)

Get him/her to a higher level as soon as you can. You don't actually need to make him level 20 since you will get a lot of XP from grinding and quests. I'd suggest to get him to level 18 and leave it there until you get the Ascension Material from the questline.

As for the weapon you don't have many choices:

* Cool Steel (3\*)
* Prototype Rancour (4\* you get it for free at AR 10)
* Fillet Blade (3\* although you won't see it much in the early game since it's from Liyue)

Prototype Rancour might seem to be a good option at first but it's actually worse than both other options for 2 reasons:

1. The main modifier is % Physical Damage Bonus while for the others is % Attack. There are some stat guides to make you understand this a bit better (checkout the official discord for the list of guides) but long story short, % Physical is almost always worse than % Attack and even then, the only characters which actually deal a decent amount of Physical Damage, those don't use a Sword.
2. Being a 4\* weapon you won't be able to reach Refinement 5 (R5 in short) in probably the next few months. You can get to R2 in 2 days or even 1 if you get lucky with the blue crystals since you get 1 sword prototype from the Souvenir Shop but after that you will be relying on high level Domain RNG to get a sword prototype (and maybe you get it from some other quests too)

So I'd say unless you will be able to get a good 5\* weapon, you should just stick with **Cool Steel** for a while. Fillet Blade is also good but it's much harder to find while you will get a lot of Cool Steel copies from the gacha as well.

For the artifacts I suggest a combination of **Gladiator's Finale** (the one from the Road event) and either the **Berserker** (12% Crit) or **the Resolution of Sojourner** (18% Attack) sets.

## 2) Amber

You can avoid investing in her at all since you won't use it as a DPS. You will only switch to apply pyro, ult, taunt or do puzzles. You won't be in combat long enough for almost anything to matter.

Unfortunately all the bows are kinda bad for her in this situation. For extra damage you can the **Raven Bow** but don't invest too much in it.

For artifacts it's a similar situation, you can just use the very early game Adventurer Set(1000 HP and 30% Heal on opening chests)

## 3) Kaeya

Similar story to Amber except Kaeya is really not that needed at all. You almost always want Amber in your party in exploration because you need an Archer but for Kaeya you don't really need him anywhere. There's also a very small amount of Cryo based puzzles to solve as well compared to Pyro ones which are almost everywhere.

## 4) Lisa

Lisa is pretty great against Water enemies and for kiting annoying mobs. If you have a Hydro Character as well you can really melt some mobs with the Electro-Charged debuff. You can invest into her unless you maybe have **Fischl** or another setup which doesn't need her.

For weapons almost all of them are decent, the only ones which I would avoid are the **Otherworldly Story** which gives you 1% HP when picking up elemental orbs and **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers** which gives you % Attack on the next character switching in.

For artifacts the **Instructor** set is fine but you can also use the same setup as for the Traveler if you want.

## 5) Noelle

She isn't exactly free but most people will get her from the Novice Banner. I'd say get her to level 40 at least since she gets a pretty nice passive (shield on any member when they get bellow 30% HP) and she is really useful when fighting Geo shields.

For the weapons, use the **Debate Club** until you can get an R5 **Skyrider's Greatsword**. You can also opt into using the **Prototype Animus** from the Road event if you get it since you also get 2 free claymore prototypes for crafting.

For artifacts you can just stick with the **Lucky Dog** set from the start. It's the only one which actually gives you DEF and unlike most characters Noelle scales with DEF for the most part. The Traveler setup might be useful for extra damage as well if you have parts to spare.

## 6) Xiangling

She is pretty strong but I didn't use her much since in exploration there are a lot of spots taken by other characters for puzzles. In Abyss and Domains however she is pretty nice.

For the weapon I suggest using R5 **Black Tassel** since it's really strong against slimes which are pretty common in Abyss. **White Tassel** sounds deceptively good but actually since it boost only Normal Attack Damage it won't do nearly as much as the other options.

For artifacts similar setup to the one for Traveler.

## Feedback

* I know it's a trade-off but I'd prefer the usual approach to talking to NPCs. What I mean is usually in RPGs if you start a dialogue you have to explicitly press the ""Goodbye"" option to leave dialogue. In Genshin it's the other way around, after choosing one option you get out of dialogue by default at the end of it which will be nice later on but it's also annoying early on because some NPCs have like 5 dialogue options and it's annoying to continuously re-open dialogue to click on them. Also some NPCs have some kinda useless first line which you have to click away to get to the actual dialogue options. Maybe merge the first line with the second one which shows the dialogue?
* On the OBT you still cannot change key binds, you have a menu for it but you can't click to change them for some reason.
* It would be nice to have a tooltip which tells you where an item is used similar to Honkai so it's easier to track what is useful and what isn't since they have the same quality and a simple Matsutake will seem as important as a Valberry unless you dig into it.

## Tips and Tricks

## Bosses

You can actually abuse terrain a lot against big bosses since they don't know how to get around stuff. Of course this doesn't work against some of the flying ones but against the Golems it will really help you trivialize the fight.

## Be resourceful

Don't waste resources on cooking or alchemy early on. You really don't need it. I actually never used a potion for the entirety of the game, I crafted some but I forgot about them all the time because if you have a healer (Barbara in my case) I don't even need to use food for healing 90% of the time so I don't end up opening my backpack.

As for characters and weapons you should only invest in the ones you use simply because wrong investments will cost you long hours or even days to fix. For example getting 1 weapon to max ascension will probably take 2 weeks or more like it takes in Honkai. It's not the end of the world but It can be really annoying.

## Always switch to Claymore users while mining special ores

Yes even for 1 blue ore.

## Be careful with long expeditions

I'd say it's not worth it to do expeditions unless you do the blue ore one at the max duration of 20 hours. Be careful that you won't be able to use that character. Most of the time I used Bennet for it since I couldn't find much use of him in my party setup and he has a special passive which reduces duration time to around 14 hours which makes it really nice to send on while going to sleep. But again be careful, **DON'T** send Noelle to expeditions unless you really know what you're doing.

## Don't level 3* or 4* artifacts past level 4

You can actually do a bit more on Feathers (maybe 10 but not 20, I don't think that's worth it) but generally speaking don't. Why level 4? Because you will need 12+ level 4 artifacts for the Adventurer's Handbook tasks.

Only heavily invest into 5\* artifacts because only those will actually matter in the long run. For weapons it's a lot more nuanced but for artifacts this is how it is.

## Don't fall into water if you don't have stamina

You will die twice until the game will just teleport you out so you don't kill of all of your characters. And in general just be really careful about going into water.

## Use the new land mechanic

It deals significant damage, instantly destroys ores, it's really fast and it negates all fall damage. You can literally land from any distance. You can literally avoid any fall death with it since it works without using any stamina.

## Enjoy the game

You can do whatever you want. I just laid out some suggestions or things I wished I knew while playing the OBT.

I suggest you don't ignore the Be resourceful and Gacha suggestions to avoid salt later on.",Genshin_Impact,Beginner Tips &amp; Tricks based on the Chinese OBT
491,OnePunkArmy,1600462945,42,1,"**Hold off on exploring until you progress the story enough to obtain a full party**

The game does not restrict you from detouring off the main quest unless you go way too far from your current region. As tempting as it appears, hold off on exploring. Progress the main story quests until you have a full party. This not only gives you access to four elements, but you will obtain the glider during this time, an important tool for exploring.

**Recruit a claymore user ASAP**

Your initial party of four will consist of two sword users, a bow user, and a magician. This leaves you without a claymore user. Claymores have higher impact per attack, which does more damage to shields, stones, and any other solid object. Outside of combat, claymores can harvest minerals much faster than other weapons. Most players will recruit Noelle as their first claymore user.

**Use Elemental Vision often while exploring**

You have access to Elemental Vision the moment you enter the game. Use Elemental Vision while exploring to reveal objects you may miss with regular vision. Refer to your platform's controls to see how to use Elemental Vision, usually triggered by holding a left shoulder button and pressing left on the right joystick.

**If you have max Original Resin, run Domains to use them up**

When you open the world map, you may notice a blue orb icon in the top right corner with a number next to it, usually 120/120. This represents Original Resin, which functions like stamina in mobile games. You use resin to complete Domains - completing a Domain consumes 20 resin. Your account will slowly recover resin over time, so make sure you run Domains so that you can keep recovering resin. You can access a level 5 Domain just south of the first Statue of the Seven, the one in the lake. Run east from Mondstadt, then take the path northeast to reach this Domain. This Domain provides EXP tomes, an important resource for leveling up your characters. Lisa will perform very well in this Domain due to her Lightning element because...

**The majority of your damage comes from elemental combinations**

Party members alone generally cannot take down strong foes on their own without utilizing a different element. You will need to swap members during combat to use another element and deal more damage. Swap characters often, since swapping only has a one-second cooldown. Unless a party member has a skill that makes their attacks deal elemental damage, melee attacks and uncharged arrows deal non-elemental damage. Charged arrows, magician attacks, and all active skills deal elemental damage. Most elements have a combination that deal increased damage (Fire + Lightning = Overload, Fire + Ice = Melt, Ice + Lightning = Super Conduct, Wind + any = Swirl). Some foes have a permanent element, such as Slimes or Abyss Mages when they have a shield up. When fighting outdoors in the rain, all targets have Water element, including you.

**When you hear a pulse sound effect and see a white star in the minimap, you will find an oculus nearby**

Oculi represent small collectibles throughout the world of Genshin Impact. Offering these to a Statue of the Seven confers multiple benefits and rewards, but most importantly, these increase your party's max stamina. The oculus type &amp; appearance depends on your region, and you can only offer these to statues in the same region. You can reach some oculi easily, while others may require climbing, jumping, gliding, solving a nearby puzzle, clearing out nearby foes, or a combination of any of these.

**If you see a small turquoise wisp with wings and a white eye, touch it and then follow it**

Throughout the world, you will spot small floating turquoise wisps called a Seelie. Luckily you cannot attack it, as these things lead to treasure, or sometimes unlocks something important you need to use nearby. Touch it, and it will start moving towards its home pedestal. Whenever it stops, touch it again. Many Seelies may require climbing or gliding to reach. Repeat this until it reaches its pedestal, which will spawn a treasure chest or generate some other beneficial effect nearby. Occasionally, you will need to do this for more than one Seelie to activate the reward. If you discover a pedestal and cannot find its Seelie, use Elemental Vision near the pedestal, and you will see a trail in the direction of the Seelie.

**Unless you grind heavily, you cannot keep every party member upgraded**

Once you start to obtain more party members, you will find your resources stretched thin if you try to keep everyone upgraded. Upgrades will consume exponentially more resources the higher you go upgrading, so unless you heavily grinded, you will constantly have low resources. Focus on a core group of four party members to keep up with the world's foes. As far as upgrading equipment, never upgrade white or green rarity items - focus on blue rarity and above. However, if you did end up upgrading a lot of characters, then consider the next point...

**Foes upscale with your Adventure Rank, so do not level your Adventure Rank until you can handle stronger foes**

All party members level up independently. However, all actions contribute toward your Adventure Rank, which represents your account level. Try to keep your core party of four around the same level as your Adventure Rank, if not higher. As your Adventure Rank rises, enemy levels will rise more. For example, at Adventure Rank 30, you will encounter level 44-48 foes. If you only focused upgrading a core group of four, that group can handle the increased enemy difficulty.

**Cook stamina-replenishing food, and always have some when exploring**

At a few locations throughout the world, you will need to glide a long distance, and gliding consumes stamina. To ensure that you survive the trip, you can eat stamina food during the glide.

but all of these might be people not used to play gacha game. Just a friendly reminder than those innocent lamb need to be guided. This game is a gacha game at heart, and while a very, very fun and beautifull one, and a more ''broad audience'' one, the core doesn't change.

  
Just remind people rerolling in a gacha game is actually the norm, but by no mean necessary,

&amp;#x200B;

just remind people the game can be fully played with the base hero,  


just remind people the game is single player and there is no rush,  


just remind people you can just relax while exploring the game, or sit somewhere like stormcliff and put that on a screen while reading something,  


just remind people this game have coop, and if they have difficulty their higher world level friend can help them out,  


Just remind people new to gacha, if they hesitate to spend it is probably because they should not spend. Gambling disorder may be new to them and going full simp for a character can lead to bankruptcy, divorce and more.

535,zannet_t,1600531156,128,1,"To put everything I'm about to say in context, I've only played for about 15 hours in the past 4-5 days ([if ID is any indication, I was the 10499th player in](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/750091569805131827/755235076358406214/unknown.png)). I went in pretty much blind and have been just doing whatever struck my fancy without trying to min-max. In other words, I haven't attempted an exhaustive sweep of the game and this isn't a comprehensive analysis by any means.

Unsurprisingly given that I've spent so much time on it already, I think Genshin is a fun game. The exploration and combat in particular have been its biggest drawing points for me.

*I. Exploration is accessible early on and it feels organic.*

Exploration may seem daunting when you start the game, but the world opens up as soon as you are able to accumulate some Oculus to upgrade your stamina a few times. By the time I acquired about 20 of them (there are currently two kinds, Anemoculus and Geoculus, corresponding to Mondstadt and Liyue) there was nothing I couldn't reach with smart stamina management, and these things aren't hard to get (usually involves climbing high and gliding down to snatch one midair), so they really aren't setting a high bar for you to dive immediately into exploration. It's no secret that Genshin drew inspiration from Breath of the Wild and I actually think it's surpassed BotW in keeping exploration interesting. The scenery is a treat if you like the aesthetics--I've been constantly climbing up or teleporting to a waypoint high up, gliding down, and looking at the varying landscapes and architectures as I go for my next objective. In the beginning you probably want to get all the waypoints activated ASAP (particularly the major ones called Statues of the Seven that heal you) so you can use them as beachheads for each area. Then if you're not looking for a nearby Oculus, you could be finding Seelies (spirit-like beings) that guides you to loot. Failing that, you could be going around chest-hunting by beating up monsters or destroying impediments. None of it feels forced either. I enjoyed just running around and checking out whatever that's nearby as I traversed the land.

A crucial aspect of exploration is maintaining the right balance on content spacing and I'd say Genshin did well with it. When I was watching videos I thought there seems to be too much empty space, but once I started playing myself I didn't feel like it's an issue because there's so much to do and look at (at least for now) and if there were more enemies populating the map I'd probably have gotten a bit of combat fatigue. In this respect I consider Genshin to be fairly analogous to Horizon Zero Dawn--where you have content to engage with almost whenever you want but it never felt overwhelming. My biggest exploration-related complaints are the fact that (1) there is some delay in your item pick-up time and (2) you have to pick up items from chests after they explode into the surroundings. The latter really pissed me off once when I had to climb up a giant tree twice to unlock a chest, whose contents promptly spilled onto different branches and the ground far below...

*II. The combat permits a good amount of creativity and keeps you on your toes.*

I think by this point everyone knows about the elemental interactions that form the backbone of the combat system. It's pretty intuitive once you're a day or so in. For instance, you can make an enemy wet using a hydro skill (or the enemy might get wet from stepping into the water) and freeze them temporarily with a cryo skill. This encourages you to set up parties in a way that takes advantage of elemental interactions and/or environmental factors. It was pretty satisfying creating a mini-snow storm with Traveler's whirlwind elemental burst after making the enemy in front of me wet and applying freeze. Simple things like blowing up explosive barrels (and following up with hydro) work too. And I particularly relish rainy days because Lisa can pretty much electrocute everything in her path. The important thing is to set up a party that makes sense for you, whether in terms of weapon or element. I like having an archer because I like whittling down higher level enemies, but not everyone will care about that. Somewhat more importantly, you might end up setting up a party that doesn't feature all your strongest characters but has the greatest elemental synergy. Of course, the elemental interactions work the other way around too so you have to watch out and learn to back off at the right times. Being frozen and absorbing hits from all sides is not fun, even when the enemies are lower level than you.

Speaking of enemies, there is a decent variety of enemies that populate the land with their own tendencies (and elements). I have not encountered anything super complicated, but they do reward you playing to each enemy's tendencies (shooting golems in their head twice in quick succession to stun them for instance). So each battle can feel like a different mini-puzzle with different combinations of environmental factors, your party members, and the enemies put in play. This has kept things fresh for me.

Overall I'd say Genshin is definitely worth trying out. I've said my piece on the exploration and the combat already, but I also think the writing and soundtrack are fairly competent, and that's pretty much all I can ask for at this stage.

This is not to say all I've only seen positive. I think my biggest potential concerns lie with its gacha economy and content pacing.

*III. The premium currency income feels abysmal.*

As a gacha gamer for years I can confidently say Genshin is easily the least beginner-friendly I know in terms of gacha income. Excluding the rolls I've gotten through giveaways, at this point I've scrounged up a grand total of 12 rolls. Yes, 12 rolls after about 15 hours of gameplay and having explored a supermajority of the available map. That might seem surprising because you get Primogems from pretty much everything: opening most chests, finding waypoints, achievements, quests, and even viewing battle tips (surprisingly, no daily login and I have no idea if it'll be a thing). But the sums are absolutely paltry. I think you get 2-10 gems (if any) for each chest depending on the difficulty of the mobs you had to kill/the amount of effort you spend to find it. Each waypoint is 5 (I forget if Statues are 10). Achievements are generally 5 with a few being 10. Quest tend to give more, but they also take a lot more time. I remember in my first hour or so I thought I did a lot of things, opened up the menu, and thought you only need 160 gems to do a tenfold, only to realize no, 160 was one roll.

Now you might argue, hey you've been screwing around for 15 hours so maybe you aren't doing it right. Sure, but in my years trying out gacha games I've never ever had to gun for premium currency at the outset just to pick up a few tenfolds. The faster way to gain Primogems seem to be daily quests (which give 60) and Spiral Abyss (which not only require AR 20 but also at least moderately leveled parties), but given [the changes to the Spiral Abyss we've heard about](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/iu98b0/update_major_changes_in_cn_obt_from_cbt3/), I'm not sure how viable it is for new players, particularly F2Ps and light spenders, for who knows how long. Particularly concerning is the fact that Spiral Abyss level 8 or above require highly leveled parties and levels 1-8 only give you a combined one-time reward of 15 rolls. So let's take a high projection and assume all existing one-time rewards (i.e. story/free character quests, exploration, and Spiral Abyss levels 1-8) gives you something like 50-60 rolls in total. That's...not a lot, especially considering the rates in this game. Every gacha I've played has given me more rolls much faster when starting out, and most of them have better rates.

This is where I'll veer into subjective commentary and advocate for two things given the low gacha income. One, to the extent that you think you'll probably keep with the game for a few months, I'd suggest that you reroll. Yes, you get a guaranteed SSR unit if you save up 90 rolls for a rate-up banner (180 to ensure you get them and not get screwed by the coin flip)...but I can't imagine 90 rolls coming earlier than the 2-month mark given how low my Primogem income has been so far. And since you're probably playing the same party for that entire period so you can access/complete Spiral Abyss ASAP (not to mention you'll be saving up for 90 or 180 rolls), you really don't want them to be bad. Like, get a waifu or a high-tier SSR so you can get rid of Amber at least. I enjoy FPS and kiting as much as anyone and I still want to replace her every waking moment. Yes, I know rerolling will suck. You will most likely give up your Get Ready for the Road rewards. PS4 players may find it too daunting to reroll since they're going to need to create a new PSN account each time, and PC/mobile players will have to bank on them not completely neutering salted email accounts. If you're the type of person to be burned out because of the reroll process, then don't reroll and dive right in. But think of it as a way to get a good start and be able to start saving for someone else you might really want right at the outset.

Two, I would recommend people wait a few weeks or months before breaking out the credit card. Yes, I know Venti's coming. Just reroll for him if you want him. But the gacha economy really feels bad enough that I don't think Genshin deserves your whaling until you have better clarity on what the income looks like in the long term, how event rewards factor in, and whether the content is something you will actually enjoy after the freshness wears off. This brings me to my final major point...

*IV. I'm not sure at this juncture whether the content pacing will be fast enough to sustain interest.*

This is probably my least substantive point and it's more of a ""we will have to wait and see"" comment than anything else, but I think it deserves a bit of space. We don't know what's going to happen from here in terms of content release schedule, but at this point there's not that much meat to the game. You can finish rummaging through the map in a week or two if you're somewhat methodical about it. The enemy variety is decent but you can adapt in at most a week's time And the quest lines don't seem that long. All that is to say you can probably clear out most if not all existing content in a month or so. After that point you'll only be grinding daily quests, recurring chests (which I hear are a thing but haven't confirmed myself), and whatever event there might be along with Spiral Abyss bi-monthly (to the extent you can manage). I'm not necessarily knocking on Genshin for not having multiple months of content now because on some level all gachas end up being a set pattern--maintaining the periodic grind while waiting for new content. And I also recognize that new games always tend to feel a little thin. But I do think monotony can set in a little harder when the optimal strat may well be to save for 90 or 180 rolls and the Primogem gain is so slow. So you may want to pace yourself a little starting out (with the one thing I would rush being your AR to gain access to more content/quests).

Again, I want to emphasize that I have enjoyed Genshin a ton and think it deserves a fair try from anyone who's interested in the open world fantasy genre. But I do think people should tread carefully at least at the beginning to feel out the monetization aspect of it.

Review bombing is a popular method of this and it does seem effective in the gaming community.

  
So my question is, are the mods in this sub willing to go with the Will Of The People and support methods of getting the devs to realize their major error on this issue, or will threads engaging in negative content be banned and censored out?

The general rates are the same. Differences are no 5\* equipment in the rate up banner, increased chances at specific characters on the rate-up, and the 2nd 5\* pull guaranteed banner unit on the rate-up.",Genshin_Impact,Common Rate Up Banner Misconception

571,MonaThighs,1600603165,147,1,"Since the OBT aired and many isues were encountered by the players a lot of them extremely worrying, to the point where Miyoho had to send an excuse letter to the chinese playerbase and that letter contained 1600 primogems aswell. Yes, this is the famous ""thank you for the support"" letter that we got. They turned an apology letter into a thank you letter for the global version, as if to hide what's going on.

This is a non exhaustive list of what's going on :


 - Huge nerf of the primogems obtainable ingame.

- Completely insane pricing, we are talking about more than 1000$  to have a character maxed out.

- Advertised rates different from calculated drop rates. (Advertised 1.6% for a 5 star, the reality is closer to 1.4%)

- Cut content form closed betas. The main story went further in previous the betas. (Big yikes)

- You get less resources by using Resin (in-game Energy) in laylines/dungeons ect

- F2P characters nerf

-Lots of bugs and issues remains unfixed, which were present in closed betas. (Game still locked at 60fps also)
 
- Hundreds of translation problems.

- Still impossible to bind your controls

- The 30 Wishes given at the start (20 aquaint fates and 1600 apology letter primogems) are only available until 1.1, players starting from  1.1 onwards will be extremely disadvantaged given the current drops and primos earning.

That doesn't mean you only need to save 105 pulls. You still want to save till 180, because this average is including the pity safety net. But you can 'expect' in the **Really Long Run**^tm to spend 104.5 pulls on every chase, as long as you always save back to 180 before trying again.

&amp;nbsp;

Hey guys.

I'm sure it's... possible... to math it, but I did a quick sim for the average number of pulls to get the Featured 5 instead. I used the rules from [here](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wishes), please sanity check my understanding:

* 0.6% chance to get a 5\* on a featured banner roll. Once you hit this roll, there's another 50% chance for it to be a Featured 5\*. Effectively a 0.3% chance to get a banner 5\*. Only for the first 5\* you pull at the start/after a feature 5\* pity reset, every pull after getting a non-featured 5\* is effectively 0.6% chance for a featured 5\*, till you get it.
* You're guaranteed a 5\* **by** the 90th pull, so if you luck out on a 5\* on your 20th pull, that counter is reset, and you're pulling up to (20+90=) 110 total.
* The guaranteed Featured 5\* part of the pity is a separate rule that doesn't care about total pulls, if you miss a Featured on a 5\* pull the next 5\*(from pity or lucking out) will be a banner 5\*.
* A Guaranteed 4\* pull can be 5\*s (ingame help says 4\* or above). But the rate isn't any higher (99.4% chance to be 4\*). An assumption since I would have expected in-game text to mention if it had a higher 5\* rate.
* Not related to the Sim itself since it stops on the first featured, but if you do get the featured character on your first 5\* pull, the 2nd is no longer guaranteed to be the featured (but if your 2nd 5\* is off-banner, the 3rd is).

Code [here](https://dotnetfiddle.net/Na7rRI) if you'd like to double check the logic. Fiddle will time out if you try to do huge number of sims, 1 million is fine but you'd have to run it on your own PC for bigger (I got the above results from 1 billion sims).

P.S. the average chance to get the 5\* if there wasn't any pity is about 235 pulls. So... save for pity.",Genshin_Impact,Average pulls till Featured 5\* (Simmed)

This would make it easier for them to spot multiple 5* accounts on the same MAC Address and investigate. Instead of currently having tons of people with tons of multiple accounts. 

I for one plan on committing 2 days straight if I have to just to re-roll and get Keqing, and if I get banned just trying to get her I will probably just drop the game, but really don't want to.

- the E skill of characters generate elemental burst energy particles of their character type. 

- dead or hurt enemies drop elemental burst energy particles that seem to be able to apply to all characters in a party.


What I‚Äôm asking is the following:

- will the E skill particles of the characters party also contribute to the bursts of party members with the same element? Will it contribute to the burst of characters who aren‚Äôt the same element?

To test this I need people to:

- damage mobs (but not kill them) with an E ability. Make sure that there are no white particles mixed in. Check to see if party members gained burst gauge from those particles, depending on their element.



Please help! This would change so much in terms of team building! The E skills seem to generate a large portion of elemental burst gauge so if it isn‚Äôt shared between party it makes rainbow teams automatically worse!",Genshin_Impact,"CN OBT players, I need your help with some experimentation!"

Xiangling is the only polearm user available when the game launches, and there's only two that have been playable so new weapon types may not need that much to launch with.

The Traveler is only way to have a Geo 5\* right now.

There are no Dendro characters playable at the moment.

Water is the only other element you can't get a guaranteed character for, unless they keep one in the Starglitter shop.

674,projectwar,1600659444,34,1,"I've tested in various ways and it seems like we'll be able to reroll on the official launch with **username created mihoyo accounts**. This is done by the official website: [https://account.mihoyo.com/#/register/email?cb\_route=%2Faccount%2FsafetySettings](https://account.mihoyo.com/#/register/email?cb_route=%2Faccount%2FsafetySettings)

This effectively allows us to do a similar thing with arknights and +1@gmails. having a username, then adding a number (or whatever you want) at the end, and creating more and more accounts. The reason for the belief this would work in-game, is because of the Ready to the road event.

previously, trying a +1@gmail doesn't work there. However, if you sign in via the above mentioned miyoho username account, **you're granted access**. Sam applies to the official games website. *Now why would you be able to do that?* That all points to being able to play the game with the same account. furthermore, within the settings of your username mihoyo account, you CAN indeed link a gmail with a +x number to it, in the case that the account needs an email to access the game. 

For the actual reroll route/method, **I detail everything in this video**: [https://youtu.be/KssW9FEb1iQ](https://youtu.be/KssW9FEb1iQ)

* Rank 5 (17-22 minutes depending if you want an extra Venti Roll) = Get to Knight Meeting &gt; Get waypoints then warp to Shrine of Seven, picking up 2 amenoculus along the way to empower the shrine = 16-17 summons total. 2-3 of those rolls can be used on Venti summon from buying Intertwined Fates
* Rank 7 Route (37-40 minutes) = Doing the above, but also completing each of the first 3 temples that give you the 3 free characters (amber, kaeya, and Lisa's Dungeon) = 30 summons, least 12-14 rolls on Venti banner.

Just due to time, Rank 5 route is best route roll wise as you'd get above 45 (47-49) summons total (3 runs). However, Rank 7 Route gives best chance at Venti, a limited unit that won't be available in standard banner after rotation, and, well, he's one of the best units, supposedly. Altho, for either method, imo, I'd just **go for the first 5 star you get**. All of them are good and ""top tier"". Tho i guess if you REALLY want to stare at Mona's thigh's there's no turning back for you is there? :\^)

Regarding PS4 users, the only way for them to reroll is if the game isn't tied to your PSN ID. If it IS tied to your PSN ID, i wouldn't bother rerolling. gonna be too annoying to do and will drive you crazy (seriously). So, hopefully that helps you decide if you want to reroll now. in the meantime while you wait, you can create multiple username accounts for the RR event [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/ys/event/e20200910-predrawcard-sea/index.html#/top](https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/ys/event/e20200910-predrawcard-sea/index.html#/top) to get those pheonix artifacts, ahead of time before the game launches :) HFGL\~",Genshin_Impact,Username Account Reroll Method (No Email) / Rank 5 Run Best Route [Guide]

[https://imgur.com/a/HG2aAJr](https://imgur.com/a/HG2aAJr)

unless mihoyo's employees are completely clueless themselves about what gets you banned and what's not, I don't understand how salting an email is like using a third party program? it makes no sense whatsoever.

above that, what is even the difference between making a mihoyo account with an email and making a mihoyo account with a username when it comes to a ban risk?

if anything, registering an account with a username should be riskier because literally anybody can just make up tons of accounts by just typing it whatever username they want, no strings attached, it's faster and easier to register by a username than it is by an email.

We are currently trying to reach miHoYo to see whether there could be more clarification. **Before there is an official statement, please discuss about the issue within this post.**

Below is a summary of the situation:

* What can be basically confirmed
   * A lot of rerolled accounts **involved in account trading** are banned in the CN server.
   * A lot of rerolled accounts **involved in cheating (using scripts/cheats to reroll)** are banned in the CN server
   * Most accounts rerolled **through a normal process** are **NOT** banned in the CN server
* What is likely to be true
   * Accounts with a certain level of inactivity after acquiring a 5-star character (as many account scalpers tend to continue rerolling for more accounts with 5-star characters) can be a factor that contributes to a ban.
   * There might be also other factors that can contribute to a ban.
* What is likely to be NOT true
   * The ban is a hardware ban. (The person who claimed about it has not provided any concrete evidence so far; I personally also failed to find any evidence that can support it.)",Genshin_Impact,On the rerolling issue

in ancient cultureÔºåQixing is (are)  ‚Äúvassals of the heaven ‚Äù, and together play important roles between the heaven and the nature, also between god and human.

In genshin worldÔºåQixing are the titles given to seven leaders of Liyue. Keqing is current yuheng, and Ningguang is current Tianquan. Interestingly although Tianquan is in the middle of seven stars, Yuheng is much brighter than her.

And there is a contradiction: the captain of Crux (Southern Cross) , is called Beidou. If that was a nickname, it would be a title above the Qixing, which showed great disrespect and provocation.

Big Dipper is used in navigation in the northern hemisphere . But in the southern hemisphere people use the Southern Cross.  This may symbolize that Qixing dominate the Liyue city but cannot control overseas. Anyway there must be a conflict between Beidou and the Qixing.

&gt;!The issue is ducks are fighting the pidgeons for their food so he wants you to gather wheat and feed the ducks.  So here it can go one of two ways:!&lt;

716,Averavic242,1600800907,20,1,"I got bored, so I collected some various tier lists that are floating out there on the interwebs to compare. First, the link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uwFssG-uiT\_QGklthm3rk9bv9ddvtWb1WAdsLrD1wj4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uwFssG-uiT_QGklthm3rk9bv9ddvtWb1WAdsLrD1wj4/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I normalized all their ratings on a scale from D to S. I added some personal comments on the quality of the sheets at the bottom, and included a notes section on some decisions I made while collating the data.

&amp;#x200B;

Main takeaway is that tier lists can mostly be ignored, and you should choose who you want. And that some lists probably shouldn't be trusted. Check the comments ;) But, if you are curious as to how similar (or dissimilar) they are, here are some random findings:

&amp;#x200B;

**Most highly-rated:**

* Venti was the only unit to get S tier on all lists.
* Diluc, Fischl, and Keqing were all rated very highly (A to S, majority S)
* Klee, Mona, and Kiki were rated very highly, with a bit more variation (B to S, majority A/S)

&amp;#x200B;

**Consistently the worst**

* Amber, Ningguang and Noelle were all consistently at the bottom
* Kaeya was also pretty consistently bad (maximum rating B, poor bloke). I'd probably still use him though because he looks like a cool cat.

&amp;#x200B;

**Most controversial**

* Honestly a lot of them. There were a bunch with wide ranges of ratings:
* D to A: Noelle and Lisa
* C to A: Bennett, Beidou, and Traveler (Geo)
* B to S (a ton!): Chongyun, Jean, Klee, Mona, Qiqi, Xiangling, and Xiao (although Xiao was only on 2 lists)
* Main take away from the ""controversial"" category is that... If they aren't ""the best"" or ""the worst"" people don't know what to make of them! lol. Like I said, it seems like all these ""middle tier"" characters perform great for some people and not so much for others. Use who you like my friend!

Essentially, I want to decide whether it's worth spending the hours upfront to reroll--and if it means more hours saved in the long run I'm willing to pay my dues.

I used to play Dragalia Lost (quit right before they fixed their ridiculous system). And you definitely didn't need great characters to clear any of the base content, but you definitely did need either great characters or at least great dragons in order to access/survive elite end-game content (aka 5\* unit or 5\* dragon or fully unbound 4\* dragon to survive the high dragon trials).

Considering that you need multiple copies of a character to max out their potential, I really want to enjoy this game slowly without the anxiety of min-maxing from the start. But I am generally concerned about how as more content is released post-launch, whether I will be falling behind because I didn't reroll for a 5\* like it happened with Dragalia Lost.

816,SunziTV,1600972464,109,1,"Ok so this may be an unpopular opinion &amp; I‚Äôm gonna be touching on things that some players don‚Äôt seem to want to hear but all I ask is that you read it with an open mind.  I hope I can change some people‚Äôs perspectives!

So I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of negative comments on this thread about monetisation of the game and re-rolling.  The majority of these complaints are about the rates of 5* characters / weapons and also about accounts used for re-rolling being banned, and measures taken that discourage rerolling.  

So when I first discovered this game, I fell in love with the ‚ÄòBreath of the Wild‚Äô like graphics as I think a lot of people did, the gameplay looked smooth and and on top of that, it‚Äôs going to be cross platform.  An open world RPG available on mobile is pretty groundbreaking too!  I liked coming to reddit and seeing people as stoked for me the release of this amazing game!

Months on, we‚Äôre now 4 days away from launch and a lot of the hype has turned into squabbling over things that in my eyes, are secondary...  It‚Äôs not necessary to spend money to enjoy all the aspects that make this game great, whether it be exploring the world, playing co-op with my friends, or to simply do nothing but absorb the breathtaking scenery this game has to offer... 

As the player we don‚Äôt often put ourselves in miHoYo‚Äôs shoes but I think it‚Äôs really important to take a step back and do just that sometimes.  Let me explain: me personally, I wouldn‚Äôt have even known who miHoYo were if it weren‚Äôt for Genshin Impact.  I, like a lot of players here, didn‚Äôt play any of their previous games.  The point I make is that if it weren‚Äôt for monetisation in the likes of ‚ÄòHonkai Impact‚Äô and miHoYo‚Äôs other previous games, Genshin Impact might not have ever even existed... That is why monetisation is critical.  It takes a lot of resources for a good game like this to come out the other end, like most businesses miHoYo has employees it has to support.

A couple more notes to make,

- the pull rate of the 4* and 5* characters / weapons is not a concern for me, nor should it be a concern for you.  

Here‚Äôs why:

1) No PVP content.  I understand the desire to have top-tier characters and gear in games with PVP functions because it could result in a bad play experience.  

2) You won‚Äôt be at a disadvantage without them.  The story can be completed with the free characters, you also receive a character of each element during the play-through meaning all content is accessible.

3) You can invest time to obtain premium currency by opening chests, yes, it might not be much but it adds up over time.  I‚Äôve played gacha games where the premium currency can only be obtained by spending, so this is actually such a blessing we should all be grateful for. 

4) Rates aren‚Äôt even that bad... Again, compared to some other gacha games the rates are quite generous.  Remember that there will be in-game events to help us get our hands on wishes!

5). The best things about this game are free. FREE.

- if miHoYo are taking measures to prevent account selling, which would have a negative impact on their revenue, I stand with them, even if this means not re-rolling.  

I had every intention to re-roll on release until the reports of accounts being banned, a 5* character or weapon is not worth 20-30 hours of progress.  When I stated this on someone else‚Äôs post, somebody responded something to the effect of ‚ÄòmiHoYo scared you out of re-rolling now so they got what they want‚Äô.  I found this quite ignorant and it had 40 upvotes so that‚Äôs what promoted me to do this write up.  It‚Äôs not a matter of miHoYo scaring me out of doing anything, it‚Äôs a matter of me respecting that miHoYo want to ensure this project is a success.  I don‚Äôt think anyone is here to see the game flop.

So I‚Äôm summary can we rewind 3-4 months to when the hype was through the roof for this game, when we were WISHING it was only 4 days away and not thinking too much into all this secondary BS.

If you read to the end I appreciate it.  I‚Äôd like to take the chance to say thanks to any miHoYo staff for making an amazing game if any do stumble across this!  :D

- Sunzi",Genshin_Impact,I might end up public enemy #1 but I can‚Äôt bite my tongue anymore.

# Genshin Artifacts

## What are they?

In Genshin Impact artifacts are what will be your armor slots in a typical RPG and also one of your main source of stats. 

Each artifact belongs to a set and each set has 2 set bonuses at 2 artifacts and 4 artifacts of the same set. There are currently 5 artifact slots and 5 types of artifacts and each can only be equipped to their corresponding slot. Each artifact has main stat and up to 4 maximum secondary stats depending on level. 

Every 4 levels of the artifact you start unlocking new secondary stats up to 4 stats. After you've unlocked all 4 stats you start upgrading them randomly as well, an upgrade basically doubles the effect (I'm not sure about the formula) of a secondary stat. This is one of the reasons why the higher the rarity the better since you can get more upgrades on the stats as well. The main stat of an artifact scales with level but the secondary stats can only get upgraded every 4 levels.

Also unlike weapons you can only level artifacts using other artifacts and you also get a **15% experience penalty** for using a leveled artifact to level another artifact. Depending on the rarity of the artifact it starts out with a different number of secondary stats, 3\* start with 1, 4\* with 2 and 5\* with 4. Also they have a different level cap, up to level 20 for 5\* artifacts.

## Artifact Types

1. **Flower of Life (Flower)**: These artifacts always have HP as their main stat. This is the least important slot for most characters.
2. **Plume of Death (Feather)**: These artifacts always have Flat ATK as their main stat. This is the most important slot for most characters.
3. **Sands of Eon (Hourglass)**: These artifacts always have a random main stat.
4. **Goblet of Eonothem (Goblet/Cup)**: These artifacts always have a random main stat.
5. **Circlet of Logos (Head)**: These artifacts always have a random main stat.

When I say random main stat, there's a huge list of possible stats. It can be anything from % ATK, flat Elemental Mastery and even % Cryo Damage.

## What do you want on an Artifact?

Since most of the stats are random this begs the question, which stats you need? Obviously this depends on many factors as it is a complex topic but I'll try to make it as simple as possible. Keep in mind that there are some quirky characters (Noelle for example which scales with DEF) which scale differently than most so keep that in mind.

For the secondary stats, generally speaking, you always want to have **% ATK (early game) / Flat ATK (early game) / Elemental Mastery (late game) / % CRIT Rate (late game) / % CRIT DMG (Late game)** as a secondary stat. Early on I'd say you should prioritize the ones with % ATK because they help you the most, later on you'd want the other stats because they scale better but as many as you can get the better, of course you shouldn't avoid an artifact because it doesn't have all of these 4 stats since it's quite likely that you won't get as lucky for it but at the same time keep in mind that unlike weapons, 5\* artifacts are always better than 4\* artifacts and bellow, so don't stress out too much on that because anyway most of them will end up as experience for 5\* artifacts, there you can go into farm hell for the best secondary stat rolls until we get a way to reroll the stats ourselves. (which will most likely come later on, but we're probably talking 6 months or even a 1 year into the game)

For the main stats on the Hourglass, Cup and Head, the story is pretty similar except here there are some other stats which can appear. For example you can get % Hydro DMG which would be good on Mona. Early on if you get any 3\* or higher artifact with % ATK as a main stat, level it up since it will help you quite a lot, even more so than sets.

## Which set bonuses should I watch out for?

Early on I'd say any set with gives you % ATK, Elemental Mastery and % CRIT for example the Resolution of Sojourner, the Instructor and the Berserker sets early on. There's also the Gladiator set from the Get Ready for The Road Event which is also decent.

## Which should I prioritize, set bonuses or good rolls?

As with all the situations, it depends, but sometimes you can easily figure it out. If your Berserker set doesn't have any % ATK main stat rolls but you have some other random pieces which do, I'd say use those because for example a 4\* artifact with a % ATK main stat will have around 20% ATK at level 8 (which is really easy to get) and this obviously beats most of the set bonuses you can get even. 

Generally speaking I'd say it's like this:

**Main Stat &gt; Set Bonuses &gt; Rarity &gt; Secondary Stats** for the early game at least. Later on I can't really say right now, we will wait and see.

## How much should I level them?

Since you will get only a 15% experience penalty when using the artifact to level up another one you shouldn't be too mindful but I'd say don't invest into 2\* artifacts at all since you will get a lot of 3\* artifacts pretty fast. Keep in mind that as you progress you will end up needing 2 teams, which means at least 20 decent artifact setups (2 Main DPS and 2 Burst Support) so don't just use everything up to make a few strong artifacts.

I'd say go up to level 12 for Feathers (if it's a 4\* with good secondary stats you can max it at level 16 even) and 8 for the rest until you have enough of them with decent stat rolls for 2 teams. Also you shouldn't bother leveling up Flower Artifacts unless they have good secondary stats, a good set and you're willing to pray to the RNG gods to get upgrades on the good stats and not the bad ones.

## TL;DR

Artifacts are your armor slots in this type of RPG and they're also your main sources of stats, early game prioritize % ATK over the other offensive stats, the Main Stat is more important than everything else early on, level them up to 12, especially feathers, until you get enough good stat rolls for 2 team, then you can even max them if you want but don't level Flowers unless they have good secondary stats and a good set and generally invest only in 3\* artifacts or higher.",Genshin_Impact,Genshin Impact Artifact Guide

838,-Niernen,1600956224,83,1,"While this might change if they add more free characters later in the story or through events, at launch there is not a proper healer character you can add to your party aside from gacha ones. Healing is often an important role in many gacha and rpg games, and most gacha give you some type of healer early on. While exploration might be fine without healing since you can heal through food, and run away, in Domains and Abyss it will became a wall to f2p players. Since you can't heal infinitely through food, harder domains will be inaccessible to f2p, which makes upgrading characters slower. Abyss will be the biggest wall, since you can't use food at all. Without any form of proper healing, f2p will get hard stuck in Abyss. This hurts even more now that Abyss does not reset monthly till after lv8 now, so f2p won't be able to get monthly rewards for a while. 

You are guaranteed get Noelle through the beginner gacha who does have some healing capabilities through her skill. It's not the same as a proper healer like Barbara but its the only free option right now. Her issue is she has to remain on field and hit opponents to heal. As a claymore user, her attacks are quite slow, which greatly limits the amount of healing she can do. She's also Geo element, which means to elemental mixing for dps when she is on the field. It might not be a big deal early on, but as you get higher in AR and enemies get tougher, healing is going to be an important role in every party.",Genshin_Impact,Anyone else concerned that all the Healers are gacha only?

For example: for a game that is cross platform, players should be able to play on multiple devices and not have any suspicion or threat of banning attached to this. Idle accounts should also not be flagged simply for being idle, because what if its just a regular person who went on vacation? Exactly how much idle time is a 'suspicious' amount of time for an account to be idle? etc. Trying to micromanage and control how and when players play the game is always a losing strategy, and all it takes is a few high profile people getting falsely banned to completely destroy the reputation of this game. The speed with which this can occur should not be underestimated.

Say the stars align and I end up with Venti, would it then be best to take the Bow from the GRftR rewards? And if Beidou, the Claymore? If Mona, the book?

Or would it generally be preferable anyway to just take the sword and give it to the MC?  

And wouldn't the blue trinkets be better if I get Venti, or Keqing for example, as they mostly do elemental damage?

I plan on playing on PC and PS4.

My questions are

Do you think this game will have a long life span in the west? The reason I ask is because I plan to play this game a lot and invest in the game.  I've not played any games that was from China that's why I ask.

Is it being ran by a Chinese company or Japanese?

Will the PS4 version be playable on PS5?

Do I need a miHoYo account for PS4?

927,papercoco,1601051577,0,1,"A new weapon is more then just one character you need enuf content for a few character, there ability‚Äôs and weapons ideals for 1-5* and events. so here is my pitch for a new weapon type 

Play style: it would be a range class that would throw the cards. 

you could do this a few different ways:
- You throw a ‚Äúhand‚Äù (maybe 5 cards think of like a gun clip) and then you have to re-draw your hand, 
-you could hold it to charge the attack (kinda like the bow) but instead of one strong shot it throws the cards on a half circle in front of you


Verity: if you just go with the ‚Äúcard imbued with magic‚Äù you don‚Äôt have to worry about the face of the card (it can just be a magic circle) and then the back of the cards can be a skin to match the other weapons (like how they have the 5* sky set) the rarer the cards the more elaborate they look (1-3* just look like a cheep deck of play cards just a plain two color pattern and a 4* or 5* can be more elaborate)

Character idea: 
- a gambler
- a fortune teller 
- a schooler 
- a Chinese style mage (using talisman idk what the actual term is)

Ability‚Äôs: the over all them of this weapon would be support or utility focus. 

- Element land minds/element AOE effect: you throw a card on the ground, and set a land mind that goes off when stepped on 

- AOE heal/buff: throw card on ground to release an AOE circle to heals or buff you and allies or debuff the enemy

- Throw a card at your feet or at an allies or at an area to create a temporary shield 

- Throw a card at your feet or an allies to give a temporary buff/heal

- A skill where you redraw 5 card with an Increase in luck making critical hits more likely to happen (or just deal more dmg)

Ideally this weapon style wouldn‚Äôt be very dmg heavy but would shine on exploration (in solo play) or in supporting a team (in multiplayer) making dungeons or bosses just a little bit more easy 
However it still has the possibility to have heavy DPS with some possible elemental set ups (example a water character throws an AOW the release a magic circle of water that deal little dmg for ___ amount of time. But can be chined with a lightning or ice character increase DPS)
Or just single attacks where you throw a card an it explodes in elemental dmg",Genshin_Impact,New weapon type: cards

Even multi-billion dollar franchises like Fortnite took forever to launch on iOS, followed by Android way later.  Genshin Impact is doing PC + PS4 + iOS + Android, in China + US + Japan + Korea at same time, with cross play out of box.  I am not aware of a game launch with this kind of complexity ever from any company.

I am a firm believer this will be the next billion dollar game franchise.  Non-Switch players wanted a BOTW-like game for a very long time.  Genshin Impact in my opinion has better graphics, story, world setting, character design, music, combat system, and RPG system/min max.  There is simply no AAA open world ARPG with anime setting, let alone cross play on so many platforms.

Please be patient, a stable launch is all we can ask for.  Genshin Impact clearly has a multi-year roadmap, events and new contents will come!

I heard about Genshin Impact a while ago and I followed the game since then.
I'm really hyped for that game. 

But I never played it and my knowledge of the game is nowhere near what I can see here.

Also, this will be my first gacha game.

I got some questions that I'd like to ask you if you have the time. 

1: I got the feeling that everybody is in a rush mode (not that it's bad) is it what we have to do with a gacha? I feel like I might miss something if I'm not rushing. 

2: Where did you get to know each characters and their abilities except on their website? Like how everybody already know which characters they would like? Did a lot of you already played the technical test/beta or you're just choosing a character with his role and his element without knowing much about it? Did you watched YouTubers/Twitchers streaming the game and got to know the characters that way? 

3: How do you already know what is worth it to do? (like which summons, ect) I heard a lot that you have to do things well. What if you make some mistakes along the way? 

I know it's a game, it's made to have fun and enjoy, but I also want to be sure that I'm doing the right things. 

Sorry for my questions, I know theses are really basics, but like I mentioned earlier that woul be my 1st experience of a gacha game. 

If you made it through, thanks a lot for your time, and can't wait to try the game üôÇ",Genshin_Impact,First gacha game. Got some questions if you have the time.

1288,SyleSpawn,1601354207,5,1,"So, yesterday I spent the whole day cruising through quests (and chests). I reached Liyue in the evening and I started to notice the quality of the content starts taking a plunge. Some stuff I noticed:

- A lot of the NPC doesn't have voice over.

- Conversation with Paimon, when exploring, doesn't have voice over. Meaning suddenly you'll start seeing subtitles on your screen where Paimon is supposedly communicating with you.

- Worse part with the subtitle (without audio) is that the text scroll super fast to the extent that I stopped reading. Look at the size of the previous point I made, imagine this shows up on your screen without warning and you have 4 seconds to read it.

I'm still early in my exploration of Liyue so I'm worried that I might see more drop of quality as I progress. Will update.",Genshin_Impact,Is it just me or does the quality of the game tapers off by the time you reach Liyue?
